# hello-world
1st Repo
I grew up fast, and I grew up hard. 
Something was wrong from the very start.
I was fighting everybody, I was fignting everything, but the only one that I hurt was me.
I've got society's blood running down my face.
Somebody help me get out of this place.
How could someones bad luck last so long?
Until I realized that I was wrong.
